# Challenge

1. Change RANGE and NUMBER_OF_GUESSES to something else.
2. It would be better if the user knew what range the number is within. Modify the program at line 22 so that it tells the user what the range is, by using the RANGE variable.
3. We could also tell the user how many guesses they’ve got left. Modify the program again to first work out how many guesses are left, then tell the user.
4. Change the program so that the range can be anything, i.e. it doesn’t always start at 0.
5. Notice what happens when you type in a word, not a number. We will explore this further when we get to File IO and Exceptions, where you will learn how to handle errors like this in a more elegant manner.
